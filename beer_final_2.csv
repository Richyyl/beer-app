11.5° PLATO,4.5,"The Plato scale is a measurement of the density of liquid. The number tells brewers how big or small a resulting beer will be—the larger the number the bigger the beer. We designed 11.5° Plato—a lower number on the beer scale—to give us just enough body to support a heavy heap of hops. The result is an easy-drinking session IPA which satisfies the thirst for hops, but urges you to have another round.",Session IPA
12th Of Never,5.5,"Tropically Hoppy. Light, yet Full-Bodied. Bright and Citrusy. Word.
The magical, mystical 12th of Never is a blend of Old and New School hops that play bright citrus, rich coconut, and papaya-esque flavors, all on a solid stage of English puffed wheat. Tropically hoppy. Light, yet full-bodied. Bright and citrusy. The 12th of Never Ale is everything we’ve learned about making hop-forward beer expressed in a moderate voice.  Pale, cold, slightly alcoholic and bitter.  It’s all we know.

16 So Fine Red Wheat Wine,11.0,"For our super heady 16 year anniversary beer we stepped on the gas and headed down the road less traveled! Our b-day present to ourselves was a racy Red Wheat Wine. The brew rips down the road at 11% ABV fueld by a 45% wheat bomb with an after burner hop shot of Amarillo, Willamette, Nelson Sauvignon, and US Goldings that pushes this baby to the limit of sensory overload. Get in. Sit down. Hold on. Shut up.",Wheatwine
17th Saison,9.0,"This year’s anni ale has everything in it but the pitch fork and a bale of hay. With over two months of fermentation and cellaring time, this saison plows the field as it harvests spicy farmhouse overtones from its primary Fraunch saison yeast. That funky monkey delivers a strapping alc 9 % by vol, seeding a perfect foundation for secondary Brettanomyces fermentation, which hoes a cornucopia of tart and effervescent flavors. Distinct citrus notes from the finishing hops cultivate a naturally freaky fresh palate tweaker. Here’s to the next 17 trips around that burning ball in the sky!",Saison
18th Anniversary Belgian Tripel,10.0,This brilliant Belgian Tripel showcases the best of our brewers as we bring to life 18 years of passion for beer and strive to crate the most interesting beers possible.

19 - Golden Belgian Style Ale,7.0,"This Golden Belgian Style Ale matured for over a year on brett in Cabernet and Merlot barrels, then was blended with a bright, citrusy hop-forward Belgian style IPA.

21st Anniversary,7.9,"For our next few anniversary releases, we’re celebrating the beer mecca of Flanders, Belgium with a little east vs. west showdown. First off is an Oud Bruin (tr. Old Brown), which represents the style from the region of East Flanders. As the name indicates, this is an old style brown ale that uses a blend of microflora: bacteria such as acetobacter, lactobacillus and pediococcus; yeasts such as cultured saccharomyces yeast and brettanomyces wild yeasts to give the beer a specific sourness and funky aroma.

420 Strain G13 IPA,6.0,"G13 IPA is a strange new strain, indeed. We took the dank hop profile you’d expect from a hazy IPA, and married it with terpenes and natural hemp flavors. The result is a big yet balanced IPA that mimics the aroma and taste of a heady, green G13. G13 IPA is a sticky super-hybrid that’s ready to rip.

Pungent and dank aromatics on this terpene infused IPA fill the room once the beer is opened. We went with an aggressive dry hop schedule which interlaces nicely with the unique flavors to bring forward citrus and earthy notes followed by a resinous finish. This one’s fire!

Bidding $420 on the lot, El Danko nailed it! With a kiss from Barker ’s Beauties as the bonus, he strutted on stage and with a wink he gave a slap on the ass to Boob Barker himself. On to the big prize, El Danko was confronted with the infamous Cliff Hanger climb! Just as the yodeler was about to cliff dive off the ledge, he came to a screeching halt.

Electric Ray - Beer Camp Across America,8.5,"As ever, San Diego’s Ballast Point looked to the sea for the inspiration behind Electric Ray. A play on the fish’s scientific name—Torpedo californica—this beer pays homage to our mutual home state, as well as to our Hop Torpedo, the source of much of the big flavor in this high voltage, hop-forward Imperial Pale Lager.

Ballast Point brought their homebrewing dreams to the big leagues and started brewing professionally, but they never forgot their roots. They still run a successful homebrewing supply shop in San Diego.  A love for hops and the ocean inspire incredible brewed and distilled offerings, and their one-of-a-kind labels boast some beautiful, and sometimes gnarly-lookin’, fish.",American Premium Lager

It’s an opportunity to explore flavor within a remarkably interpretive style. Saisons are intriguing beers as they have traditional roots, yet are a delicious forum for variation and development.  

The Four Witches art, illustrated by Kyle Bice, develops on Golden Cap’s theme, with a nod to Wizard of Oz, as L. Frank Baum wrote the book while summering in Holland, MI.  White and dark roasted wheat provide deceptively delicious body, and a playful reference to Oz’s contrast between good and wicked witches.

Fusion 17,5.5,"As you already know, this brew was designed as hybrid of WTF and Daytime with elements of Sucks thrown in, I have included a picture of how the brew progressed for those that like O.G.’s and F.G.’s. The gravity of the wort was a little higher than expected, owed to the efficiency of the brewhouse and the Daytime mash profile. Fermentation went very well and the beer finished out in about 3 days, also at a lower F.G. than expected. As a result the alcohol was indeed higher than expected, in fact the lab results just came in and our Brown Ale is 5.5% ABV. We did in fact choose Simcoe and Nelson Sauvin for the dry hop, but we also included two more of our favorites, the elusive and rare Citra and and the ever sexy Mosaic (dry hopped at 1.6 lbs/BBL). After 3 days of extraction, 2 days of cooling, and another 2 days cold stable, the beer was filtered bright last night (July 31st), and packaged this morning (August 1st). The beer is decidedly dry and drinkable, with the impressive bouquet of hop aromas and resinous kettle hop being the main event. Delicate, slightly toasted malts and a spicy rye malt backbone remain subdued, but ever present.Short version:I think as Jeremy put it on the day of recipe formulation: ""An easy drinking, hoppy brown ale.""",American Brown

G'Knight,8.7,"This beer was previously know as Gordon.

Gordon is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops.

It features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.

We brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado's first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.

Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.",Imperial IPA

Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnÃ¢â?¬â?¢t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present.

Hopivore is a wet-hopped Harvest Ale, so the hops were introduced to the kettle only hours after harvest, without being dried. Hopivore presents a round, deep hop character, balanced by modestly sweet maltiness. Expect a more herbaceous hoppiness than other hop-forward beers.",Wet Hop Ale
Hoppy Seconds,8.4,This is our first creation of an emerging new style: An American-Style Belgian Ale.

Hoppy Wheat IPA,6.2,"An assertive hop-forward twist on wheat beer.

Wheat beers tend to fall on the mild and fruity end of the beer spectrum, but as hop heads, we’re turning that idea upside down by brewing a bold, hop-forward version of a wheat IPA.

Imperial Pils,8.6,"When ya think about it, calling any PILS an IMPERIAL PILS is somewhat ironic. At the time of its creation in the dim recesses of post-stone-age / pre-X-box European city states the PILSENER style was indeed the IMPERIAL beer of its time, putting every other more colorful beer of its time to shame amidst a revolution of thermometer making. And without a doubt; its reign was long. Now American-born ales have usurped all of the imperialness there is to usurp and for the PILS to rise again, like every aspiration-ridden social ladder-climb-ing creature on the planet it must furthur evolve... This is that! We have made our own not-so-ordinary PILS every week of every year since 1996 and we have come to respect its stature in our own brewery-world..but Darwin never sleeps.

This is that beer. In the tale of the farmer with a lost ox, the last stages of are all that matter and in those desparate final moments, salvation is found.

This tropical take on the Maibock adds a Latin island flair to this traditional German style beer.
Enamored with the Latin roots of their Tampa home, Cigar City always tries to channel a bit of local history into their beers, e.g. the Humidor Series whose beers age on Spanish cedar as an homage to Tampa’s cigar making roots. Only five years old, this brewery deserves the fast praise that’s come its way.",Maibock
Yvan The Great - Beer Camp Across America,6.3,"As longtime friends, Russian River brewmaster Vinnie Cilurzo and our own Brian Grossman are no strangers to brewing experiments. While looking for inspiration for this collaboration, Vinnie and Brian decided to honor the creations of legendary Belgian brewer Yvan De Baets with their own hop-forward American-Belgian mash-up.

From complex Belgian-inspired styles to American wild ales and hoppy Double IPA’s, Russian River always pushes boundaries while respecting technique and quality. Co-owners Vinnie and Natalie Cilurzo are longtime friends of Sierra Nevada and they always have a six-pack of Pale Ale in their fridge at home.",Belgian Blonde

el Mole Ocho,8.4,"Our exploration into the flavors of mole, the legendary sauce of central Mexico. Malty aroma and rich, cocoa-laden body laced with an invigorating tinge of dries chilies and coffee.",Specialty
